For my engineering ethics class, I analyzed the ethical issues in the Boeing 737 MAX crashes. This was done using the work from Weeks 6 through 9 of the course.

The devastating Boeing 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 can teach a lot on the importance of looking at engineering problems from a holistic and ethical standpoint. While an initial look at the crashes show that there was a malfunction with the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) of the plane, a deeper dive into the failure reveals multiple social and managerial issues deeply embedded into our society. Decisions made by Boeing management, engineers, Designated Engineering Representatives (DERs), and regulators collectively demonstrate how public safety was repeatedly subordinated to business pressures, organizational incentives, and regulatory convenience. An ethical analysis grounded in the ASME Code of Ethics shows that the tragedy resulted from systemic failures in prioritizing safety, transparency, professional competence, and accountability.

A central ethical concern in the 737 MAX case is the Federal Aviation Administration’s decision to delegate large portions of the certification process to Boeing through its DER program. By delegating work to Boeing itself, the FAA put the certification process at risk of biases within the company and also did not guarantee that the people certifying would be qualified to. According to a research paper by Herkert et al. from the Science and Engineering Ethics journal, by 2018, Boeing DERs were certifying 98% of the aircraft’s systems, including MCAS. This directly conflicts with ASME Canon 2, which requires engineers and regulators to act within their competence and faithfully perform their professional duties, as well as Canon 4, which is that engineers shall act in professional matters for each employer as faithful agents and avoid conflicts of interest. Effective regulation depends on independence, and the FAA’s limited involvement weakened oversight and accountability. If regulators had maintained greater direct control over certification, critical risks may have been identified before the aircraft entered service, saving hundreds of lives. 

Equally significant was Boeing management’s prioritization of aggressive timelines and financial success over engineering safety. Facing competitive pressure and commitments to airline customers, management chose to modify an existing aircraft rather than design a new one. This decision led to the development of MCAS as a software solution to address aerodynamic changes caused by repositioned engines. Instead of allowing engineers sufficient time to rigorously test and validate the system, management imposed accelerated schedules and discouraged design changes that could trigger additional pilot training requirements. ASME Canon 1 clearly states that engineers must hold safety, health and welfare of the public as top priorities in the performance of their professional duties. By having such an aggressive timeline for the development of MCAS and prioritizing cost and schedule over safety, Boeing management violated this foundational ethical principle. This reprioritization led to devastating consequences, reiterating the fact that engineers must always prioritize safety over speed or monetary interest. 

Failures in communication and transparency further compounded these ethical violations. Boeing and the FAA agreed to portray MCAS as a minor modification rather than an entirely new system, and pilots were not informed of its existence or operation. This lack of disclosure prevented pilots from understanding how MCAS could override their inputs during flight. According to ASME Canons 4 and 7, engineers must act as faithful agents while also issuing truthful and objective public statements. Concealing critical safety information violated the ethical duty to protect those who rely on engineered systems. While Boeing could also have argued that sharing too much information would reveal company secrets and proprietary information, the lack of openness on the development of MCAS with the public caused catastrophic failure of two full aircrafts. Transparency is essential in safety-critical contexts, and the decision to limit information sharing directly undermined pilot preparedness and public trust. 

The certification and engineering development of MCAS itself raises additional ethical concerns. MCAS relied on input from a single angle-of-attack sensor, creating a single point of failure in a flight-critical system. Despite this vulnerability and the system’s expanding operational scope, DERs certified MCAS under significant organizational pressure. This decision conflicted with ASME Canon 1’s mandate to prioritize public safety and Canon 3’s requirement for engineers to continue ethical development and judgment. Certifying a system with no redundancy and limited testing that could have life-threatening consequences was extremely unsafe and not ethical, regardless of regulatory allowances or managerial expectations. Engineers entrusted with certification authority have a moral obligation to refuse approval when safety cannot be reasonably assured.

Another contributing factor was the absence of effective whistleblower protections and a corporate culture that discouraged dissent. Evidence from the case suggests that Boeing engineers did not trust that they would be protected if they raised concerns about MCAS. ASME Canon 9 states that engineers should not retaliate against colleagues for acting ethically. However, Boeing’s organizational culture, marked by secrecy and fear of reprisal, prevented engineers from speaking out. If engineers had felt safe reporting concerns without risking their jobs, critical issues may have been addressed before the aircraft entered service. The government’s failure to enforce strong whistleblower protections further enabled this culture of silence. 

Taken together, the Boeing 737 MAX crashes illustrate how multiple ethical failures can compound to produce catastrophic outcomes. Regulatory delegation without sufficient oversight, management decisions driven by financial pressure, inadequate transparency, flawed certification and engineering practices, and suppressed ethical dissent all contributed to the tragedy. An ethical analysis grounded in the ASME Code of Ethics makes clear that public safety must always take precedence over business success, convenience, or organizational loyalty. Preventing similar disasters in the future requires systemic reform, including stronger regulatory oversight, independent certification, transparent communication, protected whistleblowing, and an unwavering commitment to ethical engineering practice. Only by restoring these principles can trust in the engineering profession and the aviation industry be rebuilt.
